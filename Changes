    - Plug memory leaks in connect_async() in sendAsyncBrowseRequest(),
      which were found by the tests.
    - Allow to iterate client from test framework.
    - Croak if wrong output variable type, make API stricter.
    - Print log level and category as string with magic variables.
    - Write client log files to debug tests.
    - Improve leak ckecks in tests.
    - Refactor client and server tests.
    - Avoid posix signal handler in test server.
    - Grep for server startup in server log to avoid races in tests.
    - Test server writes log file.
    - Implement Logger class.
    - Refactor client callback.
    - In XS croak() print function name and errno strings.

    - Use perlcritic and perltidy.
    - Test that adding a node in the server and reading its value
      from the client works.
    - Use an efficient way to export constants in Perl namespace.
    - Implement UA_Client_readValueAttribute().
    - Use a function jump table for packing all variant types.
    - Make this module run on multi threaded Perl by sprinkling dTHX
      into the XS file.
    - UA_DiscoveryConfiguration and UA_FilterOperand croak when
      trying to pack them.
    - Implement all missing packed functions for builtin types.
    - To test client and server easily, implement
      OPCUA::Open62541::Test::Server and OPCUA::Open62541::Test::Client
      to handle the other end.

    - OPCUA::Open62541::sendAsyncBrowseRequest() uses optional output
      variable for request id.
    - Run static code analyse with cppcheck, remove false positives.
      The C code generated by XS is clean.
    - Use the generated VariableAttributes packed functions.
    - Implement sendAsyncBrowseRequest for client.
    - Implement OPCUA::Open62541::Variant->setScalar() and ->getScalar().
    - Make status code magic like $! containing number and string.
    - Test code with Perl::Critic.
    - Auto generate data conversion functions.
    - Support optional output parameter for addVariableNode().
    - Implement conversion functions for builtin data types.
    - Convert Perl hashes to NodeId, QualifiedName, and VariableAttributes.
    - Implement asynchronous connections for clients.

    - Use Devel::CheckLib to ensure open62541 library is available.
    - Implement type conversions for setting scalars in variant type.
    - Connect client to server.
    - Implement client and its config.

    - Implement basic functions needed to build a simple OPC UA server.
      That is "4.2 Building a Simple Server" and "11.2 Server Lifecycle"
      from the open62541 1.0.1 library documentation.
    - original version; created by h2xs 1.23 with -A -n OPCUA::Open62541
